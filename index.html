        <p> (Latin for "I spread"), also known as the Trembling Giant, is a clonal colony of a single male quaking aspen. (Populus tremuloides) determined to be a single living organism by identical genetic markers and assumed to have one massive underground root system. The plant is estimated to weigh collectively 6,000,000 kilograms (6,600 short tons), making it the heaviest known organism. The root system of Pando, at an estimated 80,000 years old, is among the oldest known living organisms.</p>
        <h4>location</h4>
        <p>Located in Fishlake National Forest in Utah, the Pando colony is the oldest and largest living organism in the world.</p>
