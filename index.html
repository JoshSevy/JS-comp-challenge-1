        <h4 class="card-titles">Pando</h4>
        <p> (Latin for "I spread"), also known as the Trembling Giant, is a clonal colony of a single male quaking aspen. (Populus tremuloides) determined to be a single living organism by identical genetic markers and assumed to have one massive underground root system. The plant is estimated to weigh collectively 6,000,000 kilograms (6,600 short tons), making it the heaviest known organism. The root system of Pando, at an estimated 80,000 years old, is among the oldest known living organisms.</p>
        <h4 class="card-info">location</h4>
        <p>Located in Fishlake National Forest in Utah, the Pando colony is the oldest and largest living organism in the world.</p>

        <p> Methuselah is a 4,851-year-old Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) tree growing high in the White Mountains of Inyo County in eastern California. It is recognized as the non-clonal tree with the greatest confirmed age in the world.</p>
        <h4 class="card-info">location</h4>
        <p>Methuselah is located between 2,900 and 3,000 m (9,500 and 9,800 ft) above sea level in the "Methuselah Grove" in the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest within the Inyo National Forest. Its exact location is a closely guarded secret, known only to a select few.</p>

        <h4 class="card-titles">Huon Tree</h4>
        <p>Lagarostrobos franklinii is a species of conifer native to the wet southwestern corner of Tasmania, Australia. It is often known as the Huon pine or Macquarie pine, although it is actually a podocarp (Podocarpaceae), not a true pine (Pinaceae). It is the sole species in the genus Lagarostrobos; one other species L. colensoi (endemic to New Zealand) formerly included has been transferred to a new genus Manoao. The genus was also formerly included in a broader circumscription of the genus Dacrydium.</p>
        <h4 class="card-info">Age</h4>
        <p>Huon pines are some of the oldest living organisms on the Earth. A stand of trees in excess of 10,500 years old was recently found in western Tasmania on Mount Read. Each of the trees in this stand is a genetically identical male that has reproduced vegetatively. Although no single tree in this stand is of that age, the stand itself as a single organism has existed that long.</p>

        <h4 class="card-titles">General Sherman</h4>
        <p> General Sherman is a giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) tree located in the Giant Forest of Sequoia National Park in Tulare County, in the U.S. state of California. By volume, it is the largest known living single-stem tree on Earth. While the General Sherman is the largest currently living tree, it is not the largest historically recorded tree. The Crannell Creek Giant, a coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) near Trinidad, California, is estimated to have been 15 to 25% larger than the General Sherman tree by volume.</p>
        <h4 class="card-info">Stands Tall</h4>
        <p> With a height of 83.8 meters (275 ft), a diameter of 7.7 m (25 ft), an estimated bole volume of 1,487 m3 (52,513 cu ft), and an estimated age of 2,300–2,700 years, it is nevertheless among the tallest, widest, and longest-lived of all trees on the planet.</p>

        <h4 class="card-titles">Sarv-e Abarkoch</h4>
        <p> The Cypress of Abarkuh (Persian: سرو ابرکوه‎ Sarv-e Abarkuh), also called the Zoroastrian Sarv, is a Cupressus sempervirens tree in Abarkuh in Yazd Province of Iran. It is protected by the Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran as a national natural monument and is a major tourist attraction with a height of 25 metres and with a perimeter of 11.5 meters at its trunk.</p>
        <h4 class="card-info">Age & Location</h4>
        <p>The exact age of the tree has been difficult to determine, but it is estimated to be between 4000 to 5000 years old. Favorable natural conditions of its location have been credited as the main reason for the tree’s longevity. There is a legend about the tree, which says the tree was first planted by Zoroaster. Coordinates: 31°7′21.3″N 53°16′47.05″E</p>

        <h4 class="card-titles">Senator Tree</h4>
        <p> The Senator was the biggest and oldest bald cypress[1] tree in the world, located in Big Tree Park, Longwood, Florida. At the time of its demise in 2012, it was 125 feet (38 m) tall, with a trunk diameter of 17.5 feet (5.3 m). The tree was thought to have been destroyed by a fire from a lightning strike, but it was later discovered that the fire was started by an arsonist.</p>
        <h4 class="card-info">Arson</h4>
        <p>On January 16, 2012, a fire was reported at the top of the Senator tree, which burned from the inside out, "like a chimney." Firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the blaze, but the tree collapsed. The charred remains of the tree now stand only 20 to 25 feet (6.1 to 7.6 m) tall. On February 28, 2012, The Florida Division of Forestry said they arrested Sara Barnes, age 26, in relation to the fire of The Senator.</p>

        <h4 class="card-titles">Jōmon Sugi</h4>
        <p> Jōmon Sugi (縄文杉) is a large Cryptomeria tree (yakusugi) located on Yakushima, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in Japan. It is the oldest and largest among the old-growth cryptomeria trees on the island, and is estimated to be between 2,170 and 7,200 years old.</p>
        <h4 class="card-info">location</h4>
        <p>Jōmon Sugi is located on the north face of Miyanoura-dake, the highest peak on Yakushima, at an elevation of 1,934 m (6,300 ft). Discovery of the tree in 1968 "sparked moves to protect the forests" of Yakushima and gave rise to the island's tourist industry, which today comprises more than half of its economy.</p>

        <h4 class="card-titles">El Árbol del Tule</h4>
        <p> (Spanish for The Tree of Tule) is a tree located in the church grounds in the town center of Santa María del Tule in the Mexican state of Oaxaca, approximately 9 km (6 mi) east of the city of Oaxaca on the road to Mitla.</p>
        <h4 class="card-info">Slowly Dying</h4>
        <p>In 1990, it was reported that the tree is slowly dying because its roots have been damaged by water shortages, pollution, and traffic, with 8,000 cars travelling daily on a nearby highway.</p>
